# adventcode

Hi¡¡ 

This is Javi Aso, a web developer from Zaragoza, Spain. 

I´m currently working for a multinational company as a full stack developer but I always try to 
resolve some of this kind of coding challenge because is so fun and adictive for me.
This year I wanna try to do all the advent problems I can because is a good challenge for me 
and also because I am learning Golang.

So, you can see here my solutions to advent code problems and use it if you need it. This are not
the better solutions or the most efficients ones but is my little contribution to this community.

If you have any questions or commentaries you can contact me on twitter: @javi_aso

This is all¡¡¡

Best regards and I wish you a merry Christmas¡¡¡
